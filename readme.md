## Mining Phase Extraction

The repository includes a small Python utility located in `scripts/mining_phase.py`
for preparing a systematic review "Mining Phase" spreadsheet. The script expects a
deduplicated CSV or Excel file of references and outputs an Excel sheet with the
following columns:

1. **Study ID** (auto-generated `M001`, `M002`, ...)
2. **Title**
3. **DOI/PubMed ID**
4. **Year of publication**
5. **Clinical vs Preclinical**
6. **Study Type**
7. **Review Focus Area**
8. **Intervention Type**
9. **Outcome Reported?**

Run the script with:

```bash
python scripts/mining_phase.py <input_file> <output_file>
```

The output Excel file will contain the cleaned and formatted mining phase data.
